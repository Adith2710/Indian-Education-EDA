# Indian-Education-EDA

This dataset contains information about Indian School Education Statistics of the year 2013-2014 to 2015-2016. Many public datasets from Indian Government are scattered and the goal here is to have all those datasets under one umbrella so that it is easy for beginners to find important datasets like this to start their Data Science journey.

Many of the Indian Government datasets on Indian Education are scattered. Luckily this link (https://www.kaggle.com/adithprabukumar/eda-on-indian-education-statistics/data) has bought all the data under one umbrella.

This repository contains the code on which an extensive EDA was done on the data.

Here are some insightful plots made using the data (code for the plots are in the python notebook)
